# AI-Assignment-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Image-Classification-
Developed ML pipeline for MNIST handwritten digit recognition: implemented KNN, SVM (RBF), Decision Tree from sklearn with GridSearchCV hyperparameter tuning and PCA (95% variance, 784→154 dims). Achieved 98.54% test accuracy (SVM), validated scratch KNN (95%). Generated confusion matrices for error analysis.
